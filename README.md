Image Processing 

Welcome to the Image Processing , a versatile project built in Python that utilizes powerful libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and NumPy. This toolkit offers a variety of tools and features for tasks such as image color detection, background removal, edge detection, object detection, and photo editing.

Features

üåê Image Color Detection

Automatically identify and highlight colors in an image.

Customize sensitivity for precise detection.

üé® Background Removal

Remove the background of an image with ease.

Perfect for creating transparent images or applying new backgrounds.

üîÆ Edge Detection

Use techniques like Canny edge detection to extract image outlines.

Useful for shape analysis, object segmentation, and more.

üîç Object Detection

Detect objects in images using pre-trained models in TensorFlow.

Supports various object detection algorithms (e.g., YOLO, SSD).

üñåÔ∏è Photo Editing

Perform basic photo editing tasks like cropping, resizing, and filtering.

Apply custom transformations and enhancements.
