# Image Processing Project 🖼️

Welcome to Image Processing, a comprehensive Python toolkit that leverages OpenCV, TensorFlow, and NumPy for advanced image manipulation and analysis tasks. This project provides a suite of powerful tools for color detection, background removal, edge detection, object detection, and photo editing capabilities.

## ✨ Features

### 🌐 Image Color Detection
- Automated color identification and highlighting in images
- Adjustable sensitivity settings for precise color detection
- Support for various color spaces (RGB, HSV, etc.)

### 🎨 Background Removal
- Seamless background removal capabilities
- Perfect for creating transparent images
- Support for different background replacement options
- Advanced algorithms for accurate foreground extraction

### 🔮 Edge Detection
- Implementation of Canny edge detection algorithm
- Multiple edge detection techniques available
- Configurable parameters for optimal results
- Ideal for shape analysis and object segmentation

### 🔍 Object Detection
- Integration with pre-trained TensorFlow models

- Real-time object detection capabilities
- Customizable confidence thresholds

### 🖌️ Photo Editing
- Basic image manipulation tools:
 
  - Filtering
- Advanced enhancement options
